Idea:

- Convert 1 (or many) notebooks into singular-spaced notebook cells (like what lib2nbdev does)
- Convert 1 (or many) files into an nbdev notebook (from an nbdev file)
- Jupyter extension to right click on a file and convert + open it (into `/tmp/`
- Jupyter extension to select a function name or code, "Play with it", and pulls cells + imports needed for all functionality in source code
